# Overview

The YouTube Video Summarizer leverages the YouTube Data API and natural language processing techniques to generate a concise summary of a YouTube video. By analyzing the video's title, description, and comments, the project aims to provide users with a summary that captures the main points and key information.

# Features

The project offers the following features:

- Video Information Retrieval: The YouTube Data API is utilized to retrieve relevant information about the video, such as the title, description, and comments.

- Text Preprocessing: The text data obtained from the video is preprocessed to remove unnecessary elements like stop words, punctuation, and special characters.

- Text Summarization: The project employs natural language processing techniques to summarize the preprocessed text data and generate a concise summary.

- Interactive HTML Interface: The summarization results are presented through an interactive HTML interface, making it easy for users to access and navigate the summarized content.
